# useState 🦄
 
Notes: 
 -`useState` lets you use local state within a function component.
 - Call signature: `const [state, stateUpdaterFunction] = useState(initialStateValue)`
 - View the [docs.](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usestate)
--- 

## Declare State Variable 
Declaring a state variable is as simple as calling `useState` with some initial state value.

## Update State Variable
Updating a state variable is as simple as invoking the updater function returned by the `useState` invocation. 

```js
  const [stateValue, updaterFn] = useState(initialStateValue);
```

## Multiple State Variables 
Multiple state variables may be used and updated from within a functional component as shown below:


## Use Object State Variable
As opposed to strings and numbers, you could also use an object as the initial value passed on to useState.
> Nb: You have to pass the entire object to the `useState` updater function as the object is replaced NOT merged. 


```js
// 🐢 setState (object merge) vs useState (object replace)
// assume initial state is {name: "Ohans"}

setState({ age: 'unknown' })
// new state object will be
// {name: "Ohans", age: "unknown"}

useStateUpdater({ age: 'unknown' })
// new state object will be
// {age: "unknown"} - initial object is replaced
 {age: "unknown"} - initial state object is replaced

```
  

## Initialize State from Function 
As opposed to just passing an initial state value, state could also be initialized from a function as shown below:

## Functional setState 
The updater function returned from invoking useState can also take a function similar to the good ol' setState.

```js
 const [value, updateValue] = useState(0)
 // both forms of invoking updateValue below are valid 👇

 updateValue(1);
 updateValue(previousValue => previousValue + 1);
```
This is ideal when the state update depends on some previous value of state.
