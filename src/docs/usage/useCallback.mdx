# useCallback üëÅ

Notes:
 - `useCallback` returns a [memoized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization) callback. 
 - Call signature: `const memoizedCallback = useCallback(function, arrayDependency)`
 -  View the [docs.](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usecallback)

## Starter Example
The following example will form the basis of the explanations and code snippets that follow.

<Editor noInline code={Starter} />

In the example above, the parent component, `<Age />` is updated (and re-rendered) whenever the "Get older" button is clicked.
Consequently, the `<Instructions />` child component is also re-rendered because the `doSomething` prop is passed a
new callback, with a new reference. This can be seen from the random text colour which changes whenever the state value `age` is updated.

> NB: Even though the `Instructions` child component uses `React.memo` to optimize performance, it is still re-rendered.

How can this be fixed? i.e prevent `<Instructions />` from re-rendering needlessly?

## useCallback with referenced function

<Editor noInline code={ReferencedFn} />

## useCallback with inline function
`useCallback` works with an inline function as well. Here's the same solution with a inline `useCallback` call.

<Editor noInline code={InlineFn} />
